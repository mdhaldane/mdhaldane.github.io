## From tech to journalism

![Me](/assets/images/DSC_0029.jpg){: width="400"}

I got my start in journalism in Arizona, after leaving the US Navy, where I worked as an IT for four years. My interests in technology and developments in Asia-Pacific led me to pursue a master’s in Beijing, where I watched the technological landscape evolve throughout the 2010s.

Today, I write and edit technology news for the *South China Morning Post* in Hong Kong. [See my work here](/work/). See my work history below.
