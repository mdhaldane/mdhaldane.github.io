My work today focuses on technology in China, but I have years of experience doing a wide range of business coverage for print and online publications.

[Look at some print clippings if you’d like.](/print/)

My work can range from technical dives into topics like [blockchain and Bitcoin](#blockchain) and [censorship](#censorship) circumvention tools like [Shadowsocks](https://www.scmp.com/abacus/tech/article/3096044/google-using-tool-chinese-users-developed-bypass-great-firewall) to the latest developments of Big Tech companies like [Xiaomi](#xiaomi) and [Huawei](#huawei).
