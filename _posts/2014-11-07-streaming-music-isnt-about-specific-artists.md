With all the hullaballoo recently about [taylorswift](http://tmblr.co/mV4Fl3h9EtbA_AoZ0ZPG8QQ) pulling her music from Spotify, people seem to have turned the incident into a an existential question for streaming services. Questioning the viability of these services if they can’t keep a few big name artists misses the point of why these services really exists, which is to allow people to find and instantly play new music.

It’s true that being able to listen to big artists instantly is an important service and a big appeal for consumers, which is why Spotify is sad to see Swift go, but the people who find value in paying $120 per year on music are listening to a LOT more music than Swift. Even though the music industry continues to be chipped away thanks to new technology and changing consumer habits, there will always be the few artists with enough stardom to pull in more money by making their music only available through paid downloads. This has been successful for Radiohead and [Beyonce](http://tmblr.co/mk6lf-9bhWWEsjmgc_hYknA), for example.

Swift’s op-ed in the Wall Street Journal earlier this year is getting quoted in nearly every article discussing this issue today, but Swift seems to be forgetting that what works for her today does not work for everyone and it certainly would not work for new artists who need as large an audience as possible to just hear their music before they can think about demanding $13 per album (which is what Swift’s _1989_ sells for on iTunes).

There also seems to be an odd backlash against the services trying to monetize new consumer habits. In some ways, streaming services might be hastening the decline of music sales. While these services have been around for years (Rhapsody was doing it more than a decade ago), the popularity of Spotify seems to have significantly helped the image of streaming services. The reason these services exist in the first place, though, is because consumers were already moving away from CDs and are now moving away from downloads. There actually was a need for a solution in the market.

This doesn’t stop people from blaming Spotify for the low payments to artists and the devaluation of music.&nbsp;The other day, [billwerde](http://tmblr.co/msoc8fENVzGBIEvmApDYQGQ) posted on Tumblr that he canceled his Spotify account because he was unable to listen to the latest hit albums from Swift and Beyonce on the service. He would no longer pay “premium prices for a non-premium experience,” he wrote.

On [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/aloe-blacc-pay-songwriters/), songwriter [aloeblacc](http://tmblr.co/mS5yL6LxO-oqkl4-cHwL4qA) wrote that we are living in "a system that [allows digital streaming services to enjoy enormous profits](http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/6296383/pandora-revenue-up-40-percent-listening-growth-softens) while music creators struggle.” His criticism of laws and rules that govern how musicians and songwriters are paid could be fair, but he has a strange definition of “profits” since most streaming services, Spotify included, have never turned a profit. He links to a story that talks about record revenues for Pandora, but it also notes that the company posted a $2 million loss. It’s an improvement over the previous year’s loss ($4.1 million), but that doesn’t mean the company is in good enough health to drastically increase payments it already makes.

Another songwriter,&nbsp;Paul Williams, wrote about something similar at [Recode](http://recode.net/2014/07/09/music-licensing-from-a-songwriters-perspective/).

I think most people are sympathetic to the argument of paying artists a “fair price,” but no one really knows how this can be done with streaming music. Sadly, the business model is cannibalizing sales before it’s become a sustainable means of distributing music itself. Additionally, I have to assume that trying to have all the music in the world available in one place comes at a cost. Spotify has spent a lot to build brand awareness and there must be a lot going on behind the scenes to coax labels to participate. In a way, I suspect that big artists participating in streaming amounts to them carrying some of the weight of those less popular. I can see why that’s not an appealing proposition for someone like Swift.

Musician [amandapalmer](http://tmblr.co/m3NOeJwWemZGevl8kPG3MSg), of Dresden Dolls fame, thinks there’s enough to go around for everyone and people shouldn’t be so greedy (I’m interpreting a bit). In her [introduction](http://boingboing.net/2014/11/05/amanda-palmer-why-fans-choose.html) to Cory Doctorow’s latest book [Information Doesn’t Want to Be Free: Laws for the Internet Age](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1940450284/downandoutint-20), Palmer discusses her philosophy of asking, the topic of her popular [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_palmer_the_art_of_asking?language=en) last year and her [book released this month](http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Asking-Learned-Worrying/dp/1455581089).

> “People actually like supporting the artists whose work they like. It makes them feel happy. You don’t have to force them. And if you force them, they don’t feel as good…
> 
> “…When people feel and know that you are keeping the channels open, doors open, airwaves unblocked, locks unlocked….they come. And they will pay their hard-earned to keep the content existing and the cycle continuing.”

Palmer has received a lot of criticism about her opinion on this, and that criticism ranges from completely understandable to confusingly hostile. Still, she seems to be right about at least one thing: the 1990s are over and are never coming back. The music business is permanently changed. Swift’s optimism for some kind of comeback seems delirious.

The good news for Swift is that artists as popular as she can afford to not have their albums up for streaming, but that means she could also afford to leave it up for streaming, so why suffer the ill will? Some fans will be upset, even if the most ardent fans are buying albums no matter what. Additionally, there are numerous ways to listen to Swift’s album online, some legal and some not. YouTube is one site in particular where people can listen to most if not all the songs on _1989_.

Another option is the route I have gone: Subscribe to Google Play Music All Access and upload additional songs not available on the service. This gives me Radiohead’s full discography on demand and allows Google to give me other suggestions based on this music that would not otherwise be in my library.

So even though Swift’s decision might make economic sense in the short run, given the new economy of music, I can’t help but feel that Swift is adhering to an old orthodoxy about art. It seems shortsighted, even if she pulls a 180 sometime in the future.

In the meantime, Google continues to recommend great music to me (especially now that Songza playlist have been integrated into the service) from albums that are available in their entirety. No matter what Werde thinks, I’m definitely still getting my money’s worth. Swift and Beyonce were never really part of my decision making process.&nbsp;
