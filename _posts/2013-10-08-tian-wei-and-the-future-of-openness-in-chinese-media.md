Tian Wei gives a guest lecture in [Rick Dunham](http://rickdunhamblog.com/)’s multimedia class at Tsinghua University in Beijing.

In 1981, Tian Wei’s family huddled around a neighbor’s small black-and-white television to watch a trial of the infamous Gang of Four, who had fallen from grace within the Chinese Communist Party.

“It was the first time that I got to know something that was called law,” Wei said.

Tian Wei is a host of two news programs, Dialogue and World Insight, on CCTV. Having worked in the industry for many years, she says she has seen some major positive shifts in Chinese media but she might be too lenient.

Wei credits China’s rapidly expanding media landscape for newfound openness in China’s legal system, which she said can be seen by the “unprecedented” access the public had to the Bo Xilai trial.

This might be an easy way to dismiss Western concerns about Chinese regression of freedom of speech. In Chinese media, censorship is always the elephant in the room. Complicating intellectually honest debate is the fact that censorship is a taboo topic in public and many Chinese people often appear defensive about any kind of criticism of China coming from Westerners.

Wei suggests that the question of whether a crackdown on social media is actually happening or not is a valid one.

“Some say this is a crackdown on Chinese social media, others disagree,” she said.

It is unclear whether this sort of locution is caution in a political academic setting or an attempt to mitigate negative Western biases. Regardless, many Chinese people consider the 1980s as the golden age of press freedom in China. It’s been all downhill since the Tiananmen Square protests in June 1989. That is probably worth mentioning when discussing the present-day and future media landscape in China.

The [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324807704579082940411106988.html) shows the effects of Chinese policy on social media are real.

To fan the fire of this debate, people in China are never arrested for criticizing the Chinese government. In fact, free speech is protected in China de jure. Of course, the truth is that popular outspoken people are targeted in China all the time.

In late August, [Charles Xue](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-27/china-s-top-tweeters-under-fire.html), a popular Chinese-American microblogger known for being critical of the government, was arrested for hiring a prostitute. The Chinese government’s methods of control are reason enough to question the claims, but whether or not Xue was involved in prostitution is certainly more of a question than why the Beijing police were there to arrest him.

Another means of controlling information in China is done under the guise of stopping the dissemination of falsehoods. A new law revealed in September threatens anyone posting “rumors” online with three years in prison if the post is seen by 5,000 people or reposted 500 times.

A [16-year-old boy has already been arrested](http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-china-arrest-rumors-internet-20130921,0,2831881.story) under the new law for questioning whether police were properly investigating the death of someone who fell from a karaoke building.

Wei smartly stopped short of saying that the treatment of the Bo Xilai trial would be the wave of the future in terms of government transparency. The trial was for show. Having the trial open to the public fit the Party’s agenda. The treatment of the Bo trial was definitely the exception, not the rule, and no serious journalist or academic believes otherwise.

If we want a serious discussion about media in China or anywhere else, we must be able to discuss facts and likelihoods without prejudice. While we are all slaves to a certain amount of bias, being oversensitive to criticism does not help bridge gaps in understanding between cultures.
