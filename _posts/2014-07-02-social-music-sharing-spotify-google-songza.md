With Google officially announcing its [purchase of Songza](http://online.wsj.com/articles/google-buys-streaming-music-company-songza-1404244899?mod=_newsreel_4), I have been thinking about how my relationship with digital music has changed over the last decade.&nbsp;

Back when everyone was still using AOL Instant Messenger and I was in high school, there was a short period of time when a plugin for that program was one of my primary forms of sharing and discovering music. A LiveJournal community organized people using this plugin. People would post the music they have available or make requests and then would add each other on AIM. The plugin allowed the user to go into another individual’s file system (with the root folder selected by the sharer, obviously) and pick the files he wanted.

This was probably the height of my music sharing and discussion. Most people I knew were on AIM, I could tell them to check out my music and pick out what they want. Likewise, if I convinced them to install the plugin, I could do the same with their music. They would recommend things to me and I would recommend things to them and it was great.

Today, Spotify seems to be addressing this desire for social music sharing. The problem with other forms of music sharing, besides the fact that most of them were illegal, is that they were impersonal. On Internet Relay Chat, I shared and downloaded music similar to how I did on AIM. But I didn’t know anyone on IRC. Napster, Kazaa and the like were not designed for sharing among friends (although it could be done if you knew your friend’s username). It was expected that the user would just search for whatever he wanted.

Sean Parker, who co-founded Napster and invested in Spotify, has mentioned that&nbsp;[social sharing is important](http://www.cnet.com/news/sean-parker-spotify-to-finish-what-napster-started/)&nbsp;(although he apparently thought&nbsp;[Napster was better at it than Spotify](http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/17/2880316/napster-spotify-social-advantage-sean-parker)). The social aspects of Spotify are a bit disappointing. Largely, it relies on Facebook to identify your friends and automatically sharing what’s currently playing. This is a bit of a passive experience, though. I never start a conversation about what I see my friends playing, and it would kind of be weird if I did. I stopped publicly sharing my Spotify listening habits after getting judged for them. Generally, trying to share music on Facebook is an awkward experience.

Similarly, I can browse a friend’s playlists on Spotify itself, but then I have to rely on friends keeping good playlists. I’m terrible at that. I rarely make playlists, but I add a lot of albums to my library.You can’t browse a person’s library, though.

There’s also little to inspire conversation. The most enjoyable thing about sharing on AIM was staying up late swapping music back and forth with another person and talking about it. Part of the the issue is how people perceive current music sharing platforms. It’s not that they’re incapable of this kind of interaction, but no one wants to use them in this way. I’m also an adult with less time for such things these days, so maybe teenagers actually use Spotify in this way. I guess I wouldn’t know.

The result of all this is that I don’t really rely much on friends for music recommendations anymore. I share some music through Xiami on WeChat, but if you don’t live in China, you probably don’t know what I’m talking about. Even the people I know in China don’t seem very inclined to do the same.

(But seriously, add me on WeChat and share music with me.)

Most of my music listening happens through two services: Google Music and Songza. So I’m excited that Google has chosen to buy Songza. Google also reportedly&nbsp;[tried to acquire 8tracks](http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/6121565/behind-googles-failed-bid-for-playlisting-startup), but&nbsp;I think Songza is a better service (I’m sure that means Google had to shell out more cash for the acquisition).

Songza and 8tracks both offer human-curated playlists, which are generally more enjoyable to listen to than algorithm-based recommendations. At least, that’s my experience.&nbsp;As soon as I discovered Songza early last year, I ditched Pandora immediately. I was not impressed by Pandora’s algorithm that attempted to guess what I wanted to listen to next, and the music was also frequently interrupted by relatively long and useless advertisements. The only ads on Songza are banner ads and sponsored playlists (the latter of which I find clever).

&nbsp;

For this reason, I hope Songza is kept as a separate service. Playlists can be integrated into Google Music (and improved recommendations by Google Now), but Songza as a separate service would still have value for non-subscribers. Sonza also apparently gets to&nbsp;[pay lower royalty rates](http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/06/google-music-could-get-touchy-feely-if-it-does-acquire-moody-playlist-app-songza/)&nbsp;since it is not an on-demand service.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As far as automated recommendations go, though, Google does a good job for me. Better than Pandora. This could just be because of how much I use Google. In addition to doing an ungodly amount of searches, I use Google for pretty much everything: It manages my email, calendar, writings and spreadsheets on Google Drive, and knows everything I watch on YouTube. I’m also an Android user, so it knows what I look at on the Play store. I even use Google+ to some extent.

In spite of all this data, I think there’s another company that understands what I like in music even more than Google: Last.fm.&nbsp;

I do not know what is keeping Last.fm alive, but I’m glad it still exists. It has several years worth of logs on my listening habits, albeit with some gaps.

CBS bought Last.fm in 2007, but they haven’t really done much with the service. The site was expected to be profitable in 2010, but it was still&nbsp;[losing millions of dollars in 2011](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/04/last-fm-reports-loss). It would be great if Last.fm could be acquired by a company more dedicated to music services than CBS, but I don’t see how it fits into the strategies of any of the major players. It wouldn’t help Google with human curation and Google probably doesn’t feel like it needs the data.

Last.fm was also more social than most other players in the space, though. People went there with the explicit purpose of browsing music and seeing what other people were listening to. If you added your friends on the site, you could share suggestions with each other, but there wasn’t really any native way to listen to it. Last.fm shut down their own radio service after it failed as a subscription-only service and they integrated Spotify playback and a YouTube-run player.&nbsp;

These things are all well and good, but none of solves what I see as the social problem. Some of the problem might be that I’ve grown up, but I do still share and discuss music with people I see in person. It’s just not convenient to do so online.

Part of the problem might be the shift to mobile. On AIM, everyone I talked to was on a desktop computer, on which they could immediately download music and listen to it. Part of the appeal of WeChat in this respect is that they’ve integrated certain players like Xiami, allowing the music to be played within WeChat. This is very convenient but services like Xiami are not legal in the U.S. and are probably even of questionable legality in China if the country actually enforced its copyright laws.

Another great thing about sharing on AIM is that if I were to go in and browse a person’s music library, I would be much more likely to start a conversation with that person than I would be on a service like Spotify. This is probably because AIM was designed for chatting and it felt weird to just grab files from someone without saying anything. Everything on Spotify, though, comes from Spotify.

I don’t know what the solution to this is. Sean Parker thinks Napster was the best thing in social music sharing and he’s an investor in Spotify and serves on the board. That’s not promising. But teenagers always seem way ahead on these things. Maybe we need to ask them what they’re doing about sharing music. Maybe WhatsApp can learn something from WeChat. Spotify is already well-integrated with Facebook. Now that Facebook owns WhatsApp, it should consider building it into a more feature-rich platform. That could be good for music.
