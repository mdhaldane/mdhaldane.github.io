In [a conversation](https://youtu.be/i_yJTCDU4uE) with economist Tyler Cowen at George Mason’s Mercatus Center, entrepreneur and venture capitalist Peter Thiel explained why he thought New York was overrated:

> “I think we basically… had a 25 year boom in finance from ‘82 to ‘07. I think that’s sort of slowly ebbing, slowly abating. It’s going to be increasingly regulated. So if want a long/short blue state trade, you want to be long California, short New York. The long/short red state trade, by the way, is you want to be long Texas, short Virginia. And if you ask what do New York and Virginia have in common, and what do Texas and California have in common, is both Teas and California are actually sort of inward focused places. California, both the Hollywood version and the Silicon Valley version, are just sort of very focused in on themselves. Texas is also a very inward focused place. And what Virginia, or let’s say D.C. and New York City have in common is they’re centers of globalization. Finance is sort of an industry that is fundamentally leveraged to globalization and D.C. is fundamentally leveraged to international geopolitics. And I would bet on globalization sort of slowly being in abeyance. I think with the benefit of hindsight we will realize that 2007 was not just the peak year of the finance boom, but also the peak year of globalization like in 1913. Happily it hasn’t resulted in a world war, at least not yet, but I think we are sort of in this period where globalization is steadily pulling back. And so you want to be in places or industries that are leveraged to things other than globalization.”

Cowen, perhaps surprisingly, although he does love contrarian arguments, agreed with Thiel. He referenced that before 2007, trade was “going up at a rate three times higher than world GDP.” Since the crisis, both have been increasing about the same rate, he said. Thiel had also explained that he thought Japan was very innovative and that he was long on that country, too, because it is not so reliant on globalization. So he naturally said he was skeptical of London and New York. For China, he was more ambivalent. He continued:

> “China is harder to evaluate on this globalization metric because on some level, the growth story is linked to exports and globalization, and then at the same time it has these capital controls and all these ways that it’s somewhat separate. So I find it always very hard to evaluate. I do think it’s interesting that questions about China are being asked less often in the U.S. today than they were a decade ago. So in 2005, it was a very widespread question: In what year will China overtake the U.S.? A decade later, it’s reasonable to think it’s a decade closer to when this will happen, it’s a much less commonly asked question. At the end of the day I suspect we’re sort of underestimating China but it may be very hard to invest. I always thought you could only participate in the Chinese boom if you are a well-connected, card-carrying member of the Chinese Communist Party. I’m not, and so it’s not been a place that I’ve really focused that much.”

The two then went on to discuss Brazil, which the two agreed was more inward looking because of its Portuguese influence, which kind of separated the country from the rest of Latin America. Ironically, Brazil is one of the few places trade as a percentage of GDP has been increasing, which it has been doing since 2009 and it is now higher than prior to the financial crisis. Trade-to-GDP has also been growing in Japan, albeit more slowly than in Brazil.

Generally, though, trade has diminished as a percentage of global GDP, as [data from the World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS) shows. It is still being debated whether the slow down in trade growth is simply a symptom of the recent recession or something more intractable. A [paper from the International Monetary Fund](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2014/12/constant.htm) supports the idea that the slowdown is structural, not cyclical, and will therefore be more prolonged.

The IMF paper contains some good news and bad news about world trade. While it does say current trends “might affect the growth potential of the world economy because trade and income are not independent of one another,” it also attributes current changes largely to changing trading patterns from the United States and China. These countries are currently seeing “changes in supply-chain trade.” China, for example, has been switching to more domestic substitutes from foreign inputs. In the 1990s, though, there was “growing fragmentation of production across borders” that led to “increases in back-and-forth trade in components.” This can be read that trading patterns are changing in part because of increased efficiency.

However, these changes in trading patters are also why long-term trade elasticity to income has declined. Throughout the ‘90s, trade was growing at more than twice as fast as GDP, but that “ended around the turn of the century. In the 2000s, a 1 percent increase in world income has been associated with only a 1.3 percent increase in world trade.”

The slowdown in trade growth is likely having an important impact on global economic growth. Europe’s economy is still in the doldrums and while there are a lot of high hopes on growth in developing economies, trade in those economies in Asia hasn’t been increasing much. The IMF paper concluded, “The scope for increasing international division of labor is still strong in Europe and could be important tomorrow for regions that have not yet made the most of global supply chains, such as south Asia, Africa, and South America.”

Looking at South Asia, though, trade-to-GDP has been stagnant over the last few years.

The picture doesn’t change much when you add in critical growing economies in Southeast Asia, although trade is shown to be a larger percentage of GDP.

One of the things highlighted in the IMF paper as an explanation for lower responsiveness of trade to income is “changes in the composition of world trade, such as the relative importance of goods versus services.” It could be that local services are becoming increasingly important as a means of growth. Digital technologies and services have certainly become more important and Southeast Asia appears to have been especially responsive to this trend. This appears to be especially true in [Indonesia](http://digitalinasia.com/2013/10/30/focus-on-indonesia-digital-landscape/) and [Vietnam](http://digitalinasia.com/2013/11/20/vietnam-digital-landscape/), which have both seen impressive increases in Internet and mobile adoption.

Foreign direct investment may also have contributed to slowing the growth in trade by helping increase the availability of domestic inputs (see the IMF report again). The same countries listed above have also been seeing increasing FDI inflows over the last several years. FDI might play an increasingly important role in growing the world economy in the future.

This begs the question, though: Why doesn’t a guy like Thiel want to invest in a place like China? Where did he get the impression that one must be a “well-connected, card-carrying member of the Chinese Communist Party” to be a successful investor in China?

China’s booming tech sector is starving for venture capital. It would seem an obvious place for a venture capitalist like Thiel to shop around for good investment opportunities. Yet, as [Reuters explains](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/15/us-china-venturecapital-idUSKBN0KO05Q20150115), “China’s venture capital market remains small, the legacy of the country’s decades of the planned economy in which private sector’s development is largely subject to a great variety of restrictions.” This is why that same story is one about a new $6.5 billion venture capital fund from the Chinese government.

Whatever role trade and FDI play in future global economic growth, it is clear that barriers still need to be taken down to promote both. Recently, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal championed by the United States and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank started by China have been topics of controversy. However, both have great potential to increase prosperity, especially in Asian developing economies.
