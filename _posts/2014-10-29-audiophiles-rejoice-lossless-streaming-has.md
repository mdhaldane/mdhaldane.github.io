It’s rare that someone tells me that the one thing missing in his or her life is lossless audio streaming (and by rare, I mean never). However, if the 320kbps standard isn’t enough for you, [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/28/7080697/tidal-brings-high-quality-audio-streaming-to-everyone-for-a-price) is reporting that there is a new option for you called Tidal, and the price of admission is a mere $20 per month:

> “This service is not for everybody,” says Andy Chen, the company’s CEO. “Spotify is for everybody. You don’t even need to pay! But for quality, you have to pay.” Chen says Tidal is aimed at audiophiles who have suffered as audio has gradually worsened in the transition from vinyl to compact discs to MP3s. “It’s for people frustrated by the progressively worse fidelity we’ve gotten from music,” he says. Streaming music is the future, and if you’ve invested in a high-end sound system — or even just decent headphones — you’re going to want to take advantage of them.

Streaming 16-bit FLAC files isn’t exactly ideal, of course. It eats up a lot of data on mobile and for good performance, I’m sure you need a pretty fast Internet connection, and one that is consistently so. I can imagine this appealing to some portion of the market with a good home setup, but I don’t know if it’s really enough for a viable business model. Are there really that many audiophiles out there?

At the Global Sources Mobile Electronics Show in Hong Kong this month, Monster founder and CEO Noel Lee told me,&nbsp;“There is nothing wrong with the quality of what we’re streaming today.” He then went on to liken it to video quality, saying people had to get used to 720p before moving on to 1080p and now 4K. That seemed to betray his original comment. I guess there is something wrong with what we’re streaming, we just don’t know it yet.

Regardless, bandwidth, data caps and other technological considerations put some serious restrictions on a service like Tidal. Also, for the convenience it offers, I’m not convinced that many people are balking at 320kbps. It’s certainly good enough for me, but I’m no audiophile and I don’t have a good sound system set up anywhere.
