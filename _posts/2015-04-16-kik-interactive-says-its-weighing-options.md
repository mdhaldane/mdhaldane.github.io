[Kik Interactive Says It’s Weighing Options, Including Selling Itself](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/business/kik-interactive-says-its-weighing-options-including-selling-itself.html?_r=0)  

Kik wants to be the WeChat of the West. Facebook Messenger has also been making some seemingly WeChat-inspired moves. While WeChat has some nice features, though, the software itself is kind of terrible. It is often unreliable. Sometimes unless the app has been opened recently, it will fail to push notifications to the phone. Additionally, the more you try to do with the app, the slower and less reliable it becomes. It can only handle so many sticker sets and so much chat history before the app becomes almost unbearable to use. There is also no way to save chat history outside the app, which can be irritating since Tencent (the app’s owner) doesn’t offer any way of accessing the app on desktops or online.

All of this makes Facebook’s strategy with WhatsApp look really smart. WhatsApp is a slim, no-frills messaging app that is fast and reliable. Facebook is largely leaving WhatsApp alone, letting the team further build its user base before trying to monetize it. That makes the app pretty enjoyable to use for its stated purpose for now. Like many foreigners, I enjoyed all the features of WeChat when I first moved to China, but I now find it frustrating that nearly every urbanite in the country relies so heavily on such a terrible piece of software.
