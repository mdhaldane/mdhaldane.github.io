Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz visited Tsinghua University’s School of Public Policy and and Management again this year on March 23. Inequality being a normal topic for him, this played a big part of his talk again and he discussed what it means for China a little bit more than he did last year, as well.

I had an opportunity to ask him about&nbsp;“[Deciphering the fall and rise in the net capital share](http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2015/land-prices-evolution-capitals-share),” by Matthew Rognlie, a PhD candidate at MIT, who has received quite a bit of attention for his critique of Thomas Piketty’s idea that returns to capital will keep increasing in the future, contributing more to inequality. Rognlie finds:

> “Overall, the net capital share has increased since 1948, but when disaggregated this increase comes entirely from the housing sector: the contribution to net capital income from all other sectors has been zero or slightly negative, as the fall and rise have offset each other.”

I asked Stiglitz what he thought it might mean for combating inequality if property is playing a larger role than previously thought. He kind of dismissed the point, saying rents in many different parts of the economy were contributing to inequality, which is what he’s been saying for a while now. This was a major point of his talk last year. However, he also distinguished between capital and wealth, a point me made earlier in his opening talk:

> “The standard model cannot explain what are called [stylized facts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylized_fact)… And those stylized facts are things like there’s been a growth in the wealth output ratio. At the same time that wages have been stagnating and the return the capital has not come down. Now why is that a puzzle as a problem? Because when the output ratio goes up, in our standard model that means that there’s more capital in the economy and more capital working with workers means that the productivity of labor should have gone up and that means wages should therefore have gone up and that means the ratio of returns is the most important idea in economics and means the returns to capital should have gone down. So we should have expected with this huge increase in some European countries, a small increase in the United States, the increase in wealth… return to capital should have gone down and wages should have gone up. Didn’t happen. Didn’t happen in most countries around the world. And the question is what is the reason. The reason is that wealth and capital are not the same… In most models they are the same… The first difference I want to focus on is land. Land is important in all of our economies. The reason the standard model dropped out land was that we grew from agriculture to industry and land was not an input in industry. A quarter of GDP in the United States has to do with housing and housing has to do with… land. And if you look at China, the scarcity is land. And most of the land value is urban land. You’ve created value out of urban land. Huge scarcity… If you start thinking about this, if the value of land goes up, does that meant there’s more land? No, there’s not more land… If the land value goes up, it doesn’t mean the country is wealthier. It doesn’t mean there’s more capital that workers can work with. So this distinction between land and wealth is an important distinction. It’s very important even here in China because a lot of inequality has been associated with the way rights over land… Even in the United States and the relationship with land and the credit system is a major source of inequality. But land rents are only one form of rents. There are monopoly rents, and monopoly rents have almost surely gone up in the United States. There are corporate control rents, exploitation rents, and rents extracted by the financial sector, and intellectual property rents. And my belief is that the increase in these rents in recent years is one of the major sources of the growth in inequality and it’s the kind of growth in wealth that does not increase productivity. In many ways it actually decreases productivity. So once you realize the source of the increase in wealth, then you understand why wages have not gone up and why the rate of the return to capital has not gone down.”

And here was the response to the question about&nbsp;Rognlie’s paper:

> “The interesting question about the recent growth of the property sector… That was really the point I was making about the land rents and land value. Absolutely. Although (that contributes to) only part of the increase (in inequality). Also the increase in property, the capitalized value of monopoly power, monopoly profits, the capitalized value of exploitation rents, the capitalized value of other kinds of rents. So a very small increase in monopoly power when capitalized can give rise to a lot of so-called wealth but actually weaken the real productivity of the economy. So that was the most general point, that we want to distinguish between capital and wealth. Now the financial sector plays a very important role in all of it. The financial sector is a very important source of monopoly power, a very important source of exploitation rents. The financial sector in the United States moved from 2 percent of GDP to 8 percent without any evidence of any increase in efficiency…”

> (Paraphrased example: The President of the United States wanted to change the standard for those managing retirement accounts saying if you manage someone else’s account, you are a fiduciary. The actual standard that we have is much lower and he wanted to raise it to the fiduciary standard. Changing that law, that difference in that legal term, gives the financial sector $10 billion in profit every year. They’re taking money right out of the pockets of retirees that gets capitalized in the value of the banks. When banks get bailed out from a problem, that also gets capitalized in the value of the banks.)

> “So it’s just not land but all these other forms of rent. But finally, the financial sector in the use of collateral and the use of credit, is one of the main ways by which property values have gone up. Even in China. Basically, if you can lend money against land and then the value of land goes up and then the banks lend more money against land and the value goes up even more and then you get more money and goes up even more. That’s what’s called a credit bubble or a property bubble and that’s what we had in the United States. Money didn’t go to create real wealth, real capital. It went to create property bubbles. Trying to change the financial system so it actually creates real wealth is one of the real challenges that we face today and it is really closely linked to the growth of inequality.”

He didn’t try to define real wealth, but the question of identifying when a market is experiencing a bubble vs when things in the market are appropriately valued is a long, on-going debate.
