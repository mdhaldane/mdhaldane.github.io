A couple years ago, the Economist put out an article about the relevance of some of [Hayek’s insights to modern-day China](http://www.economist.com/node/21537010). The article concluded, “China’s policymakers, just like their Western counterparts, will find Hayek’s diagnosis… more compelling than his prescription.”

This seems to be what Xi Jinping’s government is grappling with: How to usher in further economic liberalization and modernization in China while politically keeping a strong grip on the reigns.

The Economist is right to point out that governments take much more kindly to prescriptions of the “Master,” John Maynard Keynes. However, Keynes’ prescription involved much more market activity than the Chinese government seems willing to tolerate. In a country with large state-owned-enterprises (SOE) and one in which local governments accrue massive debt to build cities in which no one wants to live for the sake of “progress,” the Chinese Communist Party as it is today remains detached from a reality that will have to be addressed at some point in the future.

I found the Hayek quote in my post last week to be important because modern proponents of Hayek often seem to ignore the fact that he ascribed a very important and vital role to government. He was no anarchist and did not believe markets infallible or incapable of improvement by government activity. Almost no economist worth mentioning thinks this way, but the way in which the Chinese government is likely to interpret “benign” government intervention is going to involve considerable overreach.

As relevant as Keynes has been the past several years to the ailments of the U.S. economy, I think the problem in China hitherto has been malinvestments by government and placing more of a focus on Hayek, who argued that the [best allocation of resources](http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html) can only be carried out by the market, would do much more to benefit China.

Of course, I, like many others, still maintain that economic progress must eventually plateau before the country’s human capital reaches its full potential without drastic political reform. I don’t think this necessarily means reforming to a U.S.-like democracy, as good as that might be for Chinese citizens. Much could be gained from more toleration of dissent and free speech, because without it, innovations that could be great generators of wealth must be stifled (I think of all the wasted potential of Weibo as a microblogging platform).

Also consider the fact that China could potentially have the most human capital in the world (given a different political climate) but instead ranks somewhere between 90 and 100 (depending on whose measurement you look at) in GDP per capita. Granted, China’s economic liberalization is young and they probably wouldn’t yet rank near the top even given more political freedom, but I’d be willing to bet they’d be rising much faster (7 percent growth is nothing to shrug at, but it has been slowing).

Unfortunately, I have no insights into what Xi could implement that is politically feasible for him today that could really transform China’s economy. In any case, the Party is going to have to reign in local government debt and I remain hopeful about the Shanghai Free Trade Zone. Hopefully [the restrictions](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304795804579100640245613408) there don’t prove too stifling.

One last note before I go: I wonder if the more relevant debate in China is not Keynes vs Hayek but Joseph Schumpeter vs Ludwig von Mises. In an introduction to Schumpeter’s best known work, “Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy,” Richard Swedberg writes:

> “Schumpeter argues here that von Mises is wrong in asserting that socialism cannot have a rational economy since it lacks markets. The price mechanism can work in an equally efficient manner in a socialist society as in a capitalist society, Schumpeter says. This would be the case—theoretically—if all the citizens in a socialist society received vouchers (representing claims on the overall production of goods and services) and used these to shop in state- run shops. These shops, Schumpeter says, would then regulate the price in accordance with the demand of the consumers. Similarly, a central board would post ‘prices’ in response to the demand by industrial boards for the various factors of production. A system of this type, Schumpeter states, would work perfectly well—in theory as well as in practice.”

China seems to be doing its darndest to make this kind of socialist economy (combined with a healthy dose of capitalism) both globally competitive and sustainable.
