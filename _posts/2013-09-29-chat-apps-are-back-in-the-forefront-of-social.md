I just recently moved to Beijing and was informed that anyone who is anyone in China uses WeChat. So naturally I immediately downloaded it onto my Samsung GS4.  
  
Remember when everyone was on AIM? If you wanted to get ahold of someone, that’s where you turned. It seems that if you’re under 21, AIM may have never played a big role in your digital life, but those of us who grew up when AOL was the dominant Internet provider know the program well.  
  
Back in the day–can I say that at 27 years old?–AIM and LiveJournal were the primary ways people my age organized their digital social lives. These mostly got supplanted first by MySpace and then by Facebook. But now that everyone and his mother (and his grandmother) are on Facebook, the cool kids are looking for new places chill and hangout. (In case it wasn’t obvious, these new places do not include Google+, which I guess is mostly populated by techie adults.)  
  
I have now seen several articles in the vein of [this VentureBeat one](http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/01/facebook-mobile-messaging-apps/) discussing how teens just don’t find Facebook hip enough for them and are turning in droves to messaging apps. In Western countries, the app of choice seems to be WhatsApp, although Facebook messaging still dominates in the U.S. among the entire population. Interestingly, WhatsApp is very popular in Spain and South Africa.

WeChat and Line are the dominant players in Asia. WeChat is owned by China’s Tencent and Line is based in Japan.  
  
Line is the big up-and-comer. The [Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/08/27/messaging-app-line-expands-outside-of-japan/) recently reported on the new chat app boom and Line’s success:

> “To be sure, the communication app category is crowded and competitive, and some of them have similar ambitions of becoming a broader platform for social network and entertainment. WeChat, a messaging app developed by Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. has a dominant position in China, and is trying to expand overseas. Tencent said this month that WeChat had 236 million monthly active users. &nbsp;In South Korea, a homegrown app called Kakao Talk is gaining traction and the company is also looking to expand overseas.  
>   
> "What makes Line stand out is how much it has expanded outside of Japan. Japan now accounts for only 20% of Line’s users, and 80% is from overseas. Line now has 18 million users in Thailand, 17 million in Taiwan and 15 million in Spain, according to the company, even though Japan is still its largest market with 47 million users.”

This compartmentalization of chat apps can be annoying, though. A friend of mine based in Japan uses Line, but I haven’t downloaded it yet, so we still communicate with each other primarily through Facebook Messenger.  
  
I can understand the appeal of some of these apps, though. They rely on a slew of new emoji art to communicate a wide range of emotions, which isn’t so much my thing, but they also seem very lightweight and fast. Part of my perception could be tainted by the fact that WeChat works seamlessly in China whereas I have to connect to a VPN whenever I want to use Facebook.  
  
All that said, I do not really know how much more convenient any of these options are to traditional SMS. In the U.S., I blocked SMS on my Verizon account and solely switched over to Google Voice, which is basically another chat app that sends SMS messages to others. It works well for me because I can still send texts to people in the states and when it is integrated into Google Hangouts, it will be even more useful.&nbsp;  
  
However, there is still the [network effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) problem. There aren’t nearly as many people using Hangouts as I would like. Combined with Google Voice, Google messaging has far more reach, but this is not helpful for my contacts in China, where Google Voice SMS messages cannot reach and Hangouts is blocked on computers (strangely, traffic from the Hangouts app gets through without a VPN, but Google+ and Google Chat in GMail don’t work without a VPN).  
  
That leaves me with WeChat. The minor additional features that makes it feel more like a social network (like a profile and adding photos) are nice, but I spend too much time on Facebook and Google+ to care what my WeChat looks like. And now that I have WeChat, I really have little desire to add Line or WhatsApp to my phone.  
  
If Line keeps growing the way it has, maybe it will turn into the next generation’s Facebook. The rate of change in technology makes this almost impossible to predict, but I still think the re-emergence of private messaging as the key to social networking is an interesting development.&nbsp;  
  
In an age of privacy concerns, this could be how people are looking to stay off the grid (i.e. off the searchable web). This doesn’t help people against governments, though, which can easily subpoena companies for chat logs. And in the case of China, I’m sure WeChat is an open book.
